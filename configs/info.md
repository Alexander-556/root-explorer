# Explorer Config

This is a brief description of the json config folder. For now, the config folder has to subfolders: data and model. This is the starting point of the whole framework.

## Data

The data folder contains the configuration for

1. source root file location
2. target root tree name
3. ways to separate the dataset

## Model

The model folder contains the confugration for

1. input and output of the classifier
2. parameters of the classifier
3. features to use as inputs

## Next Step

Each config file has its own config loader. All config loaders follow the same format. Go visit the config loaders next!
